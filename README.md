Carrying keys has always been a hastle. It's a problem to keep them safely. But everybody carries phone while going out. What if I say that instead of keys, you can unlock the door with your smartphone via bluetooth. Simply enter the password on your smartphone and walk in!

-What if you misplace your phone?
  Still no one can get in using your phone because the person still needs to enter a password.
 
-How will you get in if you misplace your phone?
  Simply borrow a phone from someone for a second, download the app from playstore, connect to the right bluetooth device, enter the password and walk in!
